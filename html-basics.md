# HTML Basics

## What is HTML?

- HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language
- **HyperText** refers to any text/document referring i.e. linking to other documents
- **Markup** means to annotate content. We wrap our content inside **semantic tags to annotate** that it is a particular type of content. **XML** is also a markup language
- `HTML` provides **Structure** ; `CSS` provides **Style** ; `JS` provides **Behaviour**

## Resources

1. [**W3C**](https://www.w3.org/) makes the HTML standards. W3C also has an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
1. [**WHATWG**](https://whatwg.org/) consists of browser vendor groups that keep trying out new features

## Anatomy of HTML tag

```html
<p id="ap01r" class="filler intro" onClick="alert('hi')">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum
  ullamcorper rutrum orci at posuere.
</p>
```

- `p` is known as the paragraph **Element**
- `<p>` and `</p>` are the opening & closing **Tags** of a paragraph
- `id`, `class`, `onClick` are the **attributes** and their **attribute values** are specified in quotes
- The Lorem ipsum text inside the tag is called the **Content**

> **Note:**

- Most tags come in opening & closing tag pairs (`<h2>...</h2>`). However, there are some special tags that don't have a closing tag. These are called **Void element** tags i.e. they cannot contain any children inside them. Examples are `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, `<meta>`, `<link>` . Refer [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element)
- HTML does NOT have self-closing tags. For example `<img.../>` is not valid HTML
- The element name can be written in any case (upper/lower/mixed)
- No spaces between `<` and `p` or `/p` of the tags
- At least one space required before and between attributes
- Specify attributes ONLY in the opening tag

## Basic HTML Document Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Homepage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the homepage</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

- The `<!doctype html>` standalone tag is used to indicate that the document is an HTML document to be rendered in **standard mode**. Without this tag, the browser assumes the document to be of some other format or legacy standards and it will be rendered in **quirks mode**. Refer [MDN page for Quirks & Standard modes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode).
- The `<html>...</html>` tags are HTML document
- The `<head>...</head>` tags contain description about the content inside the page. This includes metadata, external resources to import, and the required `<title>...</title>` tags
- The `<body>...</body>` tag is the **root** of all content that is visible to the user. It is also called as the **viewport**
- The HTML document is rendered from top to bottom

## HTML Content Models

- Content model refers to the full behavior the browser applies to the elements belonging to that content model, and to the nesting rules of those elements. In other words, which elements are allowed to be nested inside which other elements
- Before HTML5, there were only 2 content models; elements were either **block-level** or **inline**. HTML5 split these into 7 models with more complex rules. Refer the [W3C content models page](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html)

| Block-level elements                             | Inline elements                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Begin on a new line (by deafult)                 | Continue in the same line (by default)            |
| Can contain both block or inline elements inside | Can only contain inline elements inside them      |
| Rougly translate to **Flow Content** in HTML5    | Rougly translate to **Phrasing Content** in HTML5 |

## Semantic HTML Tags

- Each type of HTML element tag has some meaning about the type of content present inside it
- Also, using semantic HTML tags help in SEO a lot of the times (esp. tags like `<h1>`)
- Technically, you can get away with just using `<div>` and `<span>` tags but using semantic tags provides a **_more meaningful separation_** between the various parts of the document

## Lists in HTML

- Lists provide a natural & commnly-used grouping for content such as to-do lists, shopping lists, recipes etc.
- In HTML, the `<ul>` (unordered list) and `<ol>` (ordered list) elements are block-level elements, and they are meant to contain list items i.e. `<li>`

> **Unordered List:**

```html
<ul>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Donuts</li>
  <li>Cookies:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Chocolates</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Peanut butter</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Pepto Bismol</li>
</ul>
```

Output: ðŸ‘‡

<ul>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Donuts</li>
  <li>Cookies:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Chocolates</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Peanut butter</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Pepto Bismol</li>
</ul>

---

> **Ordered List:**

```html
<ol>
  <li>Open box</li>
  <li>Take out cookie</li>
  <li>
    Make a Double Oreo
    <ol>
      <li>Peel off the top part</li>
      <li>Place another cookie in the middle</li>
      <li>Put back the top part</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
```

Output: ðŸ‘‡

<ol>
  <li>Open box</li>
  <li>Take out cookie</li>
  <li>Make a Double Oreo
    <ol>
      <li>Peel off the top part</li>
      <li>Place another cookie in the middle</li>
      <li>Put back the top part</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

---

> **When nesting one type of list inside another, the other list type should be wrapped within an `<li>` for valid HTML**

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Nested Item 1</li>
      <li>Nested Item 2</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

Output: ðŸ‘‡

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Nested Item 1</li>
      <li>Nested Item 2</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
